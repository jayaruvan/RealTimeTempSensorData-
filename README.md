
Using an Arduino MicroController connected to a single wire temperature sensor(DS1820B) and a photo-resistor, getting real time temperature and light intensity data to the browser in a graphical format. Node.js using Express was used for programming the server. 
JohnnyFive was used to achieve communication between Node.js and Arduino. Used Pubnub which is a Node.js module to publish the real time data reading on the web browser. 
To display the data in a live graphical format, used eon.js which is another JavaScript library to transform the JSON data to a graphical format for real time visulaization with respect to time.

Technologies Used: Node.js, Express, Arduino, JohnnyFive, Javascript, HTML5/CSS,Pubnub.js, Eon charts.
